# ALIAS Benchmarks

These are expressions found on the ALIAS
[benchmark page](http://www-sop.inria.fr/coprin/logiciels/ALIAS/Benches/)).
At the top of each file is a copy of the query as formatted in the webpage.

FPCores reference the [bibliography](bibliography.bib) file when appropriate.
Note that I cannot find a source for citation 8, "Sparse and partially separable
  test problems for unconstrained and equality constrained optimization".
It is commonly cited in different papers, but the source evades me.

Polynomial Systems problem `6body` has been renamed `six_body` in order to avoid
  names starting with numerals.
